# 🧪 Lab 13: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

**Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04+ (Cloud Lab Environment)  
**User:** toor  
**Privileges:** sudo  
**Tools:** auditd, ausearch, aureport, inotify, Bash  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- Configure kernel-level auditing using auditd
- Detect unauthorized file access and modifications
- Implement checksum-based integrity verification
- Enable real-time monitoring with inotify
- Generate incident-ready security reports

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Linux command-line fundamentals
- File permissions and ownership
- Bash scripting basics
- Core cybersecurity concepts

---

## 🧩 Lab Overview

This lab implements **professional-grade File Integrity Monitoring**, combining:

- Kernel-level auditing (`auditd`)
- Log analysis (`ausearch`, `aureport`)
- Hash-based baselines (MD5)
- Real-time detection (`inotify`)
- Continuous monitoring service
- Incident response–ready reporting

---

## 🔐 Why This Matters
File Integrity Monitoring is a **mandatory control** in:
- SOC operations
- Incident response
- Compliance (PCI-DSS, CIS, NIST)

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This lab demonstrates **enterprise-ready FIM implementation** using open-source tools and custom automation scripts suitable for production environments.
