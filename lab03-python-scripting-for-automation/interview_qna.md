# 📘 Interview Q&A – Lab 03: Python Scripting for Automation

Q1. How did you execute Python scripts from the Linux CLI?  
A. By navigating to the script directory and running `python3 script_name.py`.

Q2. What file format was used to store network device data in this lab?  
A. A CSV file containing device names, IP addresses, and status values.

Q3. Why is reading CSV files useful in cybersecurity automation?  
A. CSV files are commonly used for asset inventories, scan results, and monitoring inputs.

Q4. What was the purpose of the log writer script?  
A. To generate timestamped security log entries and store them in a log file.

Q5. How did the folder cleanup script decide which files to remove?

Q6. Why are functions important in automation scripts?  
A. They improve reusability, readability, and long-term maintenance.

Q7. Which Python concepts were used to repeat security checks?  
A. Loops such as `for` and conditional statements.

Q8. What role did conditional logic play in the network monitoring script?  
A. It helped categorize threat levels and control execution flow.

Q9. How does the password checker script help security teams?  
A. It evaluates password strength and encourages secure password practices.

Q10. Why is Python widely used for cybersecurity automation?  
A. Because it simplifies scripting, integrates easily with systems, and supports scalable automation.
